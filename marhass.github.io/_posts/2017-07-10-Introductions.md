<p>First and foremost, welcome to my blog!</p>

<br>

<p>
This site will house my upcoming assignments for my information science class, INLS 161. 
In this first post, I want to write about what I have learned so far in the class. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
Thus far, we have covered how computing works, both historically and currently; 
what <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is and why we should use it; the different types of creative commons licenses; 
and how to build a website using Jekyll and Github Pages, which is what you are looking at right now!
</p>

<br>

<p>
When I signed up for this class, I did not know what I was in for.
I was expecting a dry course about Excel databases.
The fact that it has been so closely related to computer science surprised me, 
but as the class progresses I'm realizing more and more the importance of this knowledge.
</p>

<br>
My favorite quote that I have come across while reading articles for this class comes from
the <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php">Learning the Shell</a> website:
<blockquote>
<p>
I once heard an author say that when you are a child you use a computer by looking at the pictures. 
When you grow up, you learn to read and write.
</p>
</blockquote>

The way we learn, interact, and communicate is becoming increasingly dependent on technology. 
And when I say technology, I mean computers.

<marquee>Thus, I feel eager because I know the tools I learn in this class will help me greatly.</marquee>
