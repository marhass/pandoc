<h1 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h1>
<p>I like <em>codeanywhere</em> because it's true to its name... I find it easy enough to use both at the UNC computers and at home on my laptop. Github I've also found useful, and I plan to try version control on my future papers. Or code. But probably just papers.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>See above. Also, both are fairly intuitive after you have used them a couple of times.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>I <strong><em>struggled</em></strong> at first with codeanywhere because the terminal window was downright frightening to me. It looked like we had <em><strong>broken</strong> our <strong>computers</strong></em>. But once I got to know the basic workflow--and also that I had the file tree on the left for guidance--I started to enjoy using it.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p><strong>Mostly</strong> because I had <em>never</em> touched a command line before.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I'd like to learn about Github version control for writing papers, because I do that more frequently than I write code.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
