I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

* codeanywhere
* git 
* GitHub
* markup language
* some HTML language
* up next: Pandoc!

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 

I like _codeanywhere_ because it's true to its name... I find it easy enough to use both at the UNC computers and at home on my laptop. 
Github I've also found useful, and I plan to try version control on my future papers.
Or code.
But probably just papers.

## Why? 

See above. Also, both are fairly intuitive after you have used them a couple of times.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

I **_struggled_** at first with codeanywhere because the terminal window was downright frightening to me. 
It looked like we had _**broken** our **computers**_. 
But once I got to know the basic workflow--and also that I had the file tree on the left for guidance--I started to enjoy using it.

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

**Mostly** because I had _never_ touched a command line before. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

I'd like to learn about Github version control for writing papers, because I do that more frequently than I write code.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
